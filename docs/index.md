# Welcome to the **unofficial** site of <br/>futurhome tips and tricks

This is a community-driven site for sharing tips, tricks, and solutions for Futurehome smart home products. The site was developed as a way for Futurehome users to share the knowledge and experience they've gained from owning and using one of Norway's leading smart home system.

Whether you're a new Futurehome user just getting started with your smart home setup, or an experienced user looking to optimize your system's performance, this community resource aims to help you get the most out of your investment. Here you'll find user-generated guides, 
troubleshooting solutions, creative automation ideas, and practical advice from fellow Futurehome owners across Norway and beyond.


Given the recent changes to Futurehome's business model and the transition following their bankruptcy, this independent community site serves as an important resource for users to support each other, share workarounds, and preserve valuable knowledge about these smart home systems. 
Together, we can help ensure that Futurehome users continue to enjoy the benefits of their smart home technology, regardless of corporate changes.
